# How to start

## 3 repositories

### [Backend](https://github.com/indiehack/back)
simple API example built on LoopBack

### [Frontend](https://github.com/indiehack/front)
simple example frontend with TypeScript
alternatively, an Angular seed may be used, as well - [see readme](https://github.com/indiehack/front/blob/master/README.md)

### [Server](https://github.com/indiehack/server)
contains all prerequisities for backend and frontend, combines them together
runs on a static IP on your computer: 

## Prerequisities
- read the respective readme files in each of the repositories
- mileage may vary according to your occupation and workflow
- node/io is not listed - you have it
- the server can take most of the burden in case you miss / dont want to install stuff on the local machine


## Setup
- create a directory somewhere, called ie hackathon
- cd into that directory
- clone the 3 repositories there
- go into each of the directories, read the README and act upon it :).
