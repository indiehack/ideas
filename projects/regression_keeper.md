# Regression keeper

tool to save results of tests

tests will run somewhere, produce a report with results (ideally junit format)

the testmachine will then upload the results to the RK server

the server will allow to save results per project, should store who, when and why has ran the tests

it will allow to mark tests that are problematic at the moment

it will allow to browse through results, compare runs
